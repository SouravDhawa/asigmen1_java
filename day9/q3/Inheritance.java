    * The reason behind this is to prevent ambiguity.

Consider a case where class B extends class A and Class C and both class A and C have the same method display().

Now java compiler cannot decide, which display method it should inherit. To prevent such situation,
* multiple inheritances is not allowed in java.

* for example
* public class extends Animal, Mammal{}
